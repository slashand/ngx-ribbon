# ngx-ribbon - A themable and lightweight Microsoft Office-style ribbon for Angular

# COMING SOON

`ngx-ribbon` is a feature-rich, customizable, themable, lightweight and cross-platform Outlook style ribbon for Angular. It has almost all the features you would expect from Microsoft Office ribbon, but in a light package with _no external dependencies_, though you can use it with any installable package.

It is built for modern browsers using _TypeScript, CSS3 and HTML5_ and Flexbox and Angular `>=7.0.0` and `<=8.0.0`.

See the [changelog](https://github.com/slashand/ngx-ribbon/blob/master/docs/changelog.md) for recent changes.
